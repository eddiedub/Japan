Create me the ultimate 2-week Japan vacation itinerary 🇯🇵 starting from Beirut, Lebanon. I want this plan to be completely filled and super organized, with every single detail covered. ✈️🌏

📌 Trip requirements:

Start from Beirut, flying to the best entry airport in Japan for the first 2 days of the trip (you decide).

I want to travel across all of Japan — both cities and countryside, iconic spots and hidden gems. Don't leave out any major region — cover the north, south, east, and west (not literally every single city, but very diverse!).

I want to change locations every 1-2 days max, no more.

I want to make the absolute most of my time:

6–7 activities per day minimum (excluding meals and sleep).

Only 7–8 hours of sleep per night — no extra rest or downtime needed.

I only return to my accommodation for sleep, not to chill or hang out.

I want to try every type of food possible — buffets, street food, sushi, ramen, wagyu, desserts, local specialties — everything!

📅 Itinerary structure:

Break down each day with:

⏰ Wake-up and sleep time

🗺️ Exact city/location

📍 Detailed schedule of activities (at least 6–7 per day, high energy, fun, cultural, adventurous, etc.)

✈️✈️ Include plane time (from Beirut to Japan and return), and intercity transport

🏨 Accommodation per location (only for sleep)

🍱 FOOD Section (per day):

Add a clean, separate "Foods to Try Today" section

Include local dishes, unique experiences (like themed cafes or markets), and specific restaurants if possible

🚆 TRANSPORT Section:

Add a separate "Transport Plan" section detailing:

Which trains, buses, boats, or flights to take between locations

Travel time, ticket info, and best transport passes (e.g., JR Pass, Suica)

🎯 Style:

Keep it beautifully formatted, clean, clear, and fun to follow

Use emojis to add energy and visual cues, just like above

Make it look like a digital dream itinerary I could follow on my phone
